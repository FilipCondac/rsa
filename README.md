** RSA **

This project is a simple version of how RSA works.

1.Generates a public and private key pair.

2. Encrypts using public key by taking values and running it through the RSA Algorithm.

3. Decrypts it by using the public and private keys.

4. Demonstrates how brute force works and messages can be decrypted at low bit keys!

It also has a user inteface explaining who sees what at what point in time.
